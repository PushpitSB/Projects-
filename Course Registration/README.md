In this program, you will create a priority queue to help you organize the classes you wish to take in
Spring 2023. When it’s time to register, you’ll be able to ask the queue for the top N credits worth of
courses, ranked by whether they have seats available, whether they are required for your major, and the
rating of the professor.
