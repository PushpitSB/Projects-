In P03, you each implemented instantiable classes to make a simple text-based adventure game.
If you recall, you wrote a lot of similar code (e.g. Dragon and Player) in multiple places or had
a large set of methods or fields that were used for only one type of Room (e.g. teleportLocation
or getPortalWarning()). Using the OOP concepts of inheritance, interfaces, and encapsulation,
we will iterate on the previous version of Dragon Treasure Adventure by restructuring the code
and incorporating some rudimentary graphics using the same GUI and processing library as in
P02!
