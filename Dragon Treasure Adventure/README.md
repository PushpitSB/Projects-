Before the use of modern computer graphics that we are familiar with, computer games often
relied solely on text to convey information to the user in a genre called ”text-based games”.
Some popular examples include Zork, Hunt the Wumpus, and even the original Oregon Trail!
For this program used object-oriented programming concepts to build such a game
by coding our own objects and practicing ArrayLists! The player will be put into a cave of
interconnected rooms and move around to try to reach the room with the treasure! But be
careful... there are dangers like mystical portals and a fire-breathing dragon lurking in the cave!
