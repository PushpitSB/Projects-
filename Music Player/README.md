In this program, I created a queue-based music player that loads song files from your local
machine and plays them using your computer’s sound output (speakers or headphones). You’ll interact
with this music player using a text-based console menu that you will also create.
Familiarity with the Java library we’ll use to accomplish this, javax.sound.sampled, isn’t the point of
this assignment, so we’ll provide an interface to the library for you to use by way of a JAR file as we did
with the GUI libraries earlier this semester.
