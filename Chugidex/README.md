For this project I collected Chugimon pocket monsters. There are 22,650 (completely
unique and not at all derivative) Chugimon which populate the magical land of Yudabuyu.
That’s a lot of Chugimon!

In order to store your collectable Chugimon I wrote a recursive binary search tree
(BST) to provide storage for a Chugidex. No loops allowed! A binary search tree is a data
structure used to reduce to the average time complexity of certain operations like add, lookup,
etc.

To visualize your collected Chugimon, we have provided a GUI which will work once your BST
methods are implemented. Hooking up the GUI isn’t a required part of the assignment, but it
can help you determine if your add, previous, and next methods are working correctly. We
have also added an extra challenge for those who would like to make the Chugidex GUI more
full-featured
