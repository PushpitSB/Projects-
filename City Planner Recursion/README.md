Imagine you are at the Camp Randall Arch, and need to walk to the Mosse Humanities Building.
To do so, you need to travel about five blocks east, and two blocks north. How many possible
paths could you take between the two (there are 21 not including side streets), and precisely
what do these paths look like? In this assignment I used object-oriented design patterns
and recursion in order to solve the two problems of counting and enumerating possible walking
paths on a city block grid.
